6. Cross-Chain and EVM Compatibility on Stacks

Stacks increasingly interacts with EVM chains via:

Bridges

Wrapped assets

Bitcoin-backed liquidity (sBTC)

Solidity contracts deployed on EVM chains can:

Interact with Stacks-based assets

Trigger Stacks contract calls indirectly

Use Bitcoin finality as a settlement layer

Sandbox testing becomes essential to simulate cross-chain message flows and failure scenarios safely.
