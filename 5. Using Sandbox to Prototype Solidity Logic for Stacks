5. Using Sandbox to Prototype Solidity Logic for Stacks

Even if contracts ultimately run in Clarity, many teams:

Prototype logic in Solidity

Validate economic and access-control behavior

Translate stable patterns into Clarity

With Sandbox environments, developers can:

Simulate Solidity contracts

Test edge cases (re-entrancy, permissions)

Validate business logic before rewriting for Stacks

This reduces errors and accelerates migration to Bitcoin-secured smart contracts.
