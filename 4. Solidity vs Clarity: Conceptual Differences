4. Solidity vs Clarity: Conceptual Differences

Solidity and Clarity differ fundamentally, but the logic patterns are familiar:

Concept	Solidity (EVM)	Clarity (Stacks)
Execution	Turing-complete	Decidable
Reverts	require, revert	Explicit error handling
State	Mutable	Explicit state transitions
Transparency	Runtime evaluation	Readable on-chain logic

Sandbox tools help Solidity developers map known patterns (ownership, access control, escrow, NFTs) into Stacks-compatible logic.
