8. Benefits for Solidity Developers

Using Sandbox tools with Stacks provides:

Faster onboarding from Ethereum to Bitcoin L2

Lower learning curve when translating Solidity patterns

Reduced deployment costs

Stronger security guarantees via Bitcoin anchoring

For Solidity developers, Stacks represents a new execution environment, not a replacement—but Sandbox makes the transition practical.
