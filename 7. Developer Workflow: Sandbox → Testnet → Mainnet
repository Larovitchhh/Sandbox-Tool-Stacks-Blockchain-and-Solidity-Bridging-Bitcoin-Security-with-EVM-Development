7. Developer Workflow: Sandbox → Testnet → Mainnet

A recommended workflow for Solidity-minded developers entering Stacks:

Sandbox

Test logic

Break things safely

Observe failure modes

Testnet

Deploy translated contracts

Test PoX and transaction ordering

Validate fees and execution

Mainnet

Deploy with confidence

Leverage Bitcoin security

Minimize costly mistakes

Skipping Sandbox almost always results in paid failures on mainnet—something Stacks developers quickly learn to avoid.
