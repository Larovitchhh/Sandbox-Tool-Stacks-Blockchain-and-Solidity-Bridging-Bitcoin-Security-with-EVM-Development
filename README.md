Sandbox Tool, Stacks Blockchain, and Solidity: Bridging Bitcoin Security with EVM Development
1. Introduction: Why Sandbox + Stacks Matters

The Stacks Blockchain brings smart contracts and decentralized applications to Bitcoin without changing Bitcoin itself. Traditionally, Stacks uses Clarity, a decidable smart contract language. However, many developers come from an EVM / Solidity background.
The Sandbox tool plays a critical role here: it provides a safe, isolated environment where developers can experiment, test logic, and simulate deployments before interacting with real networks. Combining Sandbox workflows with Stacks opens the door for Solidity developers to transition smoothly into the Bitcoin ecosystem.
