3. Stacks Blockchain in a Nutshell

Stacks is a Layer 2 blockchain anchored to Bitcoin via the Proof of Transfer (PoX) consensus mechanism. Key characteristics:

Smart contracts settle on Bitcoin

No re-org risk beyond Bitcoin finality

Native BTC integration (and upcoming sBTC)

Focus on security, transparency, and predictability

While Clarity is the native language, Stacks increasingly interacts with EVM-based ecosystems, making Solidity knowledge more relevant than ever.
