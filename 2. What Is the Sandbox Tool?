A Sandbox tool is a controlled execution environment that allows developers to:

Test smart contract logic safely

Simulate transactions and failures

Inspect execution results without paying real fees

Iterate quickly without risking mainnet funds

In the Stacks ecosystem, the Sandbox (such as the Hiro Explorer Sandbox) enables developers to deploy and test contracts locally or in a simulated chain environment before pushing to testnet or mainnet.
